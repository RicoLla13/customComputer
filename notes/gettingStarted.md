# Getting started

## First steps to outline the project

1. Define the goals of the project
2. Learn the basics
3. Study some ICs
4. Choose between a Microcontroller or Processor
5. Design the circuit
6. Breadboard prototyping
7. Programming
8. Assemble the computer
9. Test and troubleshoot
10. Expansion and Experimenting

## Choosing between a Microcontroller or a Microprocessor

### Microcontroller

- Low Power usage
- Integrated system (GPIO, timers, ADC)
- Low cost
- Limited Processing Power

### Microprocessor

- High Processing Power
- Versatility
- External Peripherals
- OS
- Dev flexibility

### My demands

- Power consumption doesn't matter
- Cost must be not to big, not to small
- Highly versatile
- Extensible
- Will probably build and OS for it
